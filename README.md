Machine learning models can recognise unusual credit card transactions and fraud. The first and foremost step involves collecting and sorting raw data, which is then used to train the model to predict the probability of fraud[2]. The solutions offered by machine learning for credit card fraudulent detection involve:

Classifying whether credit card transactions are authentic or fraudulent using algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), deep neural networks along with autoencoders, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Predicting whether it is the cardholders or the fraudsters using the credit cards through credit card profiling
Using outlier detection methods to identify considerably different transactions (or 'outliers') from regular credit cards transactions to detect credit card fraud.
The benefits of using machine learning for credit card fraud detection
Machine learning (ML) models are much better than conventional fraud detection models. They can recognise thousands of patterns from large datasets. ML offers an insight into how users behave by understanding their app usage, payments, and transaction methods. 

Some of the benefits of fraud detection using ML are as follows:
Faster detection
A machine learning model can quickly identify any drifts from regular transactions and user behaviours in real time. By recognising anomalies, such as a sudden increase in transactional amount or location change, ML algorithms can minimise the risk of fraud and ensure more secure transactions.

Higher accuracy
Conventional fraud detection techniques cause errors at the payment gateways that sometimes result in genuine customers being blocked. With sufficient training data and insights, ML models can achieve higher accuracy and precision, reducing these errors along with the time required to be spent on performing manual analysis.

Improved efficiency with larger data
Once an algorithm picks up different transactional patterns and behaviours, it can efficiently work with large datasets to separate authentic payments from fraudulent ones. The models can analyse huge amounts of data in seconds while offering real-time insights for improved decision-making capabilities.
